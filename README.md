# Information's
CombatLog has been tested on versions 1.17.1 - 1.19.3, but probably works on most versions of Minecraft. If you find compatibility issues report them in the [Issues](https://github.com/EternalCodeTeam/CombatLog/issues) tab.
CombatLog uses java 11+, so you need to have it installed on your server.
